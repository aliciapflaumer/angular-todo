# Angular Todo

**Work in progress**

A simple to do list app with an Angular frontend and Ruby on Rails backend, to include authentication.

## Steps

First before creating application, I run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install dependencies.

Next, I run `ng new my-app-name` to create the application

  - `cd my-app-name`

  - `ng serve --open` to launch on local server `localhost:4200`
